#' # Landau notation
#' $O$, $\Omega$, $\Theta$ represents the worst, best and average speed of 
#' growth of computations with respect to the sample size $n$. Read this [post](http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/57/how-does-one-know-which-notation-of-time-complexity-analysis-to-use)
#' for a clear explantion.

#' # Big O notation
#' Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to 
#' describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on 
#' disk) by an algorithm. This is why it's also said "big-O uppper bound runtime
#' for a function".

#' The worst case here means the algorithm runs in the worst possible scenario,
#' i.e., for a sorting algorithm, the worst case is the array is sorted in the 
#' reversed order, for a binary searching algorithm, the worst case is the 
#' target number is located at the last step of the binary search instead of 
#' right in the middle or at the index of exactly divisible by the power of 2.
#' This is the actual meaning of worst case.

#' The worst cases, the average cases and the best cases can differ 
#' dramatically because of the constant multiplier.

#' # Resorvior sampling
#' Resorvior sampling is a sampling method for streaming of data. For a 
#' sample of $n$ data points in the stream, the probability that each point
#' is sampled is equivalent.

#' # Palindrome
#' Palindrome is an interesting phenomena that a string or an interger
#' is the same with its reversed version. The following chunks of code 
#' give three versions of string palindrome algorithms and one integer
#' algorithm.

# String efficient recursive
def isPalindrome1(x):
    if len(x) <= 1:
        return True
    return x[0] == x[-1] and isPalindrome1(x[1:-1])

# String efficient recursive
def isPalindrome2(x, start, end):
    if start > end:
        return True
    return x[start] == x[end] and isPalindrome2(x, start+1, end-1)

# String loop
def isPalindrome3(x):
    i, j = 0, len(x)-1
    while i < j:
        if x[i] != x[j]:
            return False
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    return True

s0 = "HelloworlddlrowolleH"
print(isPalindrome1(s0))
print(isPalindrome2(s0, 0, len(s0)-1))
print(isPalindrome3(s0))

#' The palindrome can also happen on integers, however, the exact 
#' algorithm is slightly different. 

# Palindrome integer 
def isPalindrome(x):
    div = 1
    while x // div >= 10:
        div *= 10
    while x > 0:
        l = x // div
        r = x % 10
        if l != r: return False
        x = (x % div) // 10
        div //= 100
    return True

isPalindrome(101010101010101010101)
# %timeit isPalindrome(101010101010101010101)

#' # Shuffling
#' This chunk of code is from leetcode.

# for i in range(len(ans)-1, 0, -1):     # start from end
#     j = random.randrange(0, i+1)    # generate random index 
#     ans[i], ans[j] = ans[j], ans[i]    # swap

#' Another exercise was from a video on Udacity.

#' # Combinations
#' This chunk of code is for algorithms generating all combinations of an 
#' array.

class parent(object):
    def __init__(self, param):
        self.v1 = param
class child(parent):
    def __init__(self, param):
        self.v2 = param

obj = child(5)
# __init__ is overwritten, therefore, self.v1 never exists.
try:
    print(obj.v1, obj.v2)
except:
    print("The object has no attribute 'v1'.")

#' # The essence of object reference and variable name
#' A variable name is essentially a reference to an object, even in the 
#' simplest form of assignment. This is a big distinction with C++ where
#' an assignment is a binding to a piece of memory where the value of 
#' the variable name resides, whereas in Python the name is essentially
#' a reference to an object.

#' The chance that Leo got a Red Packet as small as or smaller than 0.37 is 
#' not bad at all, it's about $7.12%$ based on the algorithm on-line. There 
#' ought to be a theoretical answer to that question.

sum(rslt1[0] <= 0.37)/1000000

#' There's a Monte carlo error in the above approach. For the first draw, it's
#' a uniform distribution between 0.01 and the first maxVal which is $71/27*2=5.26$
#' in this case. Therefore the theoretical probability of having a value as small 
#' or smaller than 0.37 is $(0.37-0.01)/(5.26-0.01)=0.0686$.

#' The above analysis is actually wrong, because 0.01 is not the ending point since
#' even though the distribution is cut-off at 0.01, at 0.01, it's a point-mass with 
#' probability 0.01. Therefore, the above calculation is actually $0.37/5.26=0.0703$,
#' which is quite close to the simulation result.

#' After doing 10000 runs of simulations with each run having 10000 simulations, the 
#' probability of getting a red packet in the first draw as small as or smaller than 
#' $0.37 is a bell-shaped curve with mean 0.0713 and standard deviation 0.0026. So 
#' the number I got the first time is surprisingly close to the true value. However,
#' the theoretical result should be 0.0703 instead of 0.0712, but why am I getting 
#' 0.0712? Can rounding error be the reason since every returned money amount is 
#' rounded with 2 decimal points. And it turns out that it is the case. After having
#' the rounding errors being taken care of, the mean is now $0.07034$ and the 
#' standard error is 0.00256. Now, this study can come to an end. No, not yet, but
#' why? Right, many values like 0.371 or 0.378 would be rounded to be 0.37 which would
#' increase the probability by about 0.01 and this is exactly what we observed. To
#' study a problem to this level of clarity is really not an easy thing.

#' The individual distributions of payoffs are interesting as well. It would need 
#' further study.

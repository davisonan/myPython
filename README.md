# myPython

Many tools are designed in the python ecosystem for data science. Organizing the toolbox well can give certainly help create a crystal view about what can be achieved and what cannot.

- Python

The fundamental Python programming language, given its high-level OOP style plus the rich collection of data structures, is very quick and helpful in learning other computer science concepts and techniques, such as algorithms, data structures, internet-related topics, etc. Although a mastery of the underlying Python programming language is not a must to do data science, it's always convenient if you have a good grasp of it. During the process of solving algorithmic challenges on Leetcode, I've seen many scenarios when a good knowledge of Python can make the solutions concise and neat, when I'm still programming Python in the relatively raw C++ programming style.

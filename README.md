# myPython

Many tools are designed in the python ecosystem for data science. Organizing the toolbox well can give certainly help create a crystal view about what can be achieved and what cannot.

- Python

The fundamental Python programming language, given its high-level OOP style plus the rich collection of data structures, is very quick and helpful in learning other computer science concepts and techniques, such as algorithms, data structures, internet-related topics, etc. Although a mastery of the underlying Python programming language is not a must to do data science, it's always convenient if you have a good grasp of it. During the process of solving algorithmic challenges on Leetcode, I've seen many scenarios when a good knowledge of Python can make the solutions concise and neat, when I'm still programming Python in the relatively raw C++ programming style.

- requests (urllib, urllib2): It's said [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2018026/what-are-the-differences-between-the-urllib-urllib2-and-requests-module) that requests is better than the other two most of the cases. Given my current usage of the url related functionalities, I'd accept that statement and focus on understanding the functionalities of this module.

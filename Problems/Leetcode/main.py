# for [1,2,3,4,7,9,11,13,15], the [1,2,3,4] and [7,9,11,13,15] 
# are two blocks with difference 1 and 2, respectively.
# Once we know the lengths, which are 4 and 5, then the number 
# of slices are just (n-1)(n-2)/2, which is, n-2 + n-3 + ... + n-(n-1) 
# for each n. Then just create a list of maximum lengths of blocks 
# and apply the above formula. Enjoy!

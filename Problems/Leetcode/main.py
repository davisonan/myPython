# Comment: xor is the number of all the xor operations. The single digit 1
# indicates the two numbers are different in this digit. Mask is to find the 
# first such digit from right to left. Once it's found, this mask is effectively
# separating the numbers into two subgroups, one with this digit as 1, and the
# other with this digit 0. However, since each number appears twice, all the
# others could be canceled by the xor operation, except the only number in 
# each subgroup.
